# Twilio Webhook Boilerplate Joule


This is a boilerplate Joule that can act as a starting point for creating Joules which use Twilio's webhook API.

## Configure your Joule

The `.joule.yml` file already includes the 3 environment variables you'll need to use Twilio's API. This lets you securely use your Twilio secrets without having to check them into your repository.

* TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, Your Twilio account sid.
* TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, Your Twilio account auth token.
* FROM, Your Twilio phone number (1XXXXXXXXXX).

## Call your Joule

Calling your Joule is simple. When viewing your Joule you will see instructions on how to call your API.

## Update your Joule

Your Joule is automatically updated each time you push to your master branch on GitHub.
